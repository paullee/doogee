I wanted to keep a regular journal, but writing it out by hand was a pain.  
I thought about using blogging software, but it seemed like overkill and
I wanted to keep things simple.  So, here it is.

* Database: sqlite3
* Search: ferret
* Interface: sinatra, haml
* ORM: datamapper

Therefore, you'll need the following gems: dm-core, do_sqlite3, ferret, haml, sinatra 

Before you start, you'll need to create the database file in the "data" directory:
@sqlite3 entries.db < schema.sql@

To start it up:
@ruby diary-cow.rb@

Then open a browser to:
@localhost:4567@
